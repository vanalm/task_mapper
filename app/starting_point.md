# Graph Model Agent 
An interactive assistant that manages maps and paths through states/nodes via tasks/edges

## Potential Features

- Agent receives user objective explicitly via chat
- Agent receives user objective implicitly via chat
- Agent helps uncover root objectives 
- Agent receives tasks and intermediate states explicitly from user
- Agent produces tasks and intermediate states related to root objective(s)
- Agent receives P(success), time, cost for each task explicitly via chat
- Agent produces estimates of P(success), time, cost for each task
- Agent collects data on time cost and success rate for each task
- Agent parses list of edges(tasks) and nodes(states)
- Edges and Nodes are instantiated
- Graph is built
- Tasks and states can be added at any time
- Task attributes can be updated at anytime within the graph.
- Agent can call optimization algorithms/functions
- Agent can report on results from optimization algorithms
